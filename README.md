## Problem Statement

It is a one time initialization game, where player initializes live cells at the start and waits for next generation.
The next generation depends on following conditions

* Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
* Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
* Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
